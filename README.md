# Electrohydrodynamic (EHD)/Ionic Thruster and 50kV 100W High Voltage Power Converter (HVPC)

The aim of this project was to construct a working EHD thruster powered by a custom 50kV 100W Flyback HVPC.

This project was split into four parts:
1. Building the HVPC
2. Building the EHD thruster
3. Conducting the research experiment, which answered the research question: 
To what extent does the spacing of electrode pairs affect the thrust produced by a single-stage electrohydrodynamic
(EHD) thruster with two electrode pairs in parallel operation?
4. Answering the research question by deriving the theoretical results of the experiment from MIT's ionic thruster research and my own original approach.

All four parts of this project were successfully completed. More information about each step can be found in the following places:
1. For more information about the research, and the general functioning of an EHD  thruster, please see the EHD thruster research overview document in the main folder.
2. For schematics, 3D files and images, please see the respective ionic-thruster and HVPC folders.
3. For the research paper abstract, please see the PDF in the main folder.
